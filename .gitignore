# Ignore generated WebAssembly artifacts and other build outputs for this project.
# This file lives in the likeag6/ directory so paths are relative to that directory.

# --- WebAssembly build artifacts (generated) ---

# If you put wasm into a different path, ignore the common names as well

# NOTE:
# - The Go runtime bootstrap `wasm_exec.js` is not included in this ignore file by default.
#   You can choose to commit `frontend/wasm/wasm_exec.js` for convenience, or let CI copy it
#   from your Go installation during builds. If you want to ignore it, add:
#     frontend/wasm/wasm_exec.js
# - If you have other generated files you want ignored, add them here.
